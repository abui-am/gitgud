# Autocommit Per File Feature

## Overview

The `autocommit-per-file` (or `acpf`) feature allows you to commit files individually with AI-generated commit messages. This is particularly useful when you have multiple changes that should be committed separately with different commit messages.

## Usage

```bash
gg autocommit-per-file
# or
gg acpf
```

## How it Works

1. **List Changed Files**: The tool displays all files with changes (modified, added, or untracked)
2. **Interactive File Selection**: You can select which files to commit using arrow key navigation:
   - Use ‚Üë/‚Üì arrow keys to navigate
   - Press Enter to select an option
   - Select individual files one by one
   - Select all remaining files at once
   - Proceed with currently selected files
   - Exit at any time
3. **File Processing**: For each selected file:
   - Shows the diff for that specific file
   - Asks for additional context (optional)
   - Generates an AI-powered commit message
   - Asks for confirmation before committing
4. **Loop Process**: After processing all selected files, you can continue with remaining files or exit

## Example Workflow

```
=== Autocommit Per File ===
This will help you commit files individually with AI-generated commit messages.
Use arrow keys to navigate and select files. You can select multiple files interactively.

=== Interactive File Selection ===
Select files one by one. You can repeat this process until you're done.

Files selected so far: 0
Remaining files: 3

  üìÑ Select all remaining files
  ‚ùå Exit
  üìÑ main.go
  üìÑ README.md
  üìÑ test_feature.txt

[User navigates with arrows and selects main.go, then test_feature.txt]

- Changed files to commit

## Tips

- You can skip files by answering 'n' when asked to commit
- The feature respects your `.autocommit.md` rules
- Each commit is made separately, so you get granular commit history
- Use arrow keys for easy navigation - no need to type numbers
- You can select files incrementally and see your progress
- The interface shows clear visual feedback with colors and icons
